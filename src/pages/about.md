## A Thinking Person's 21st Century



Its not likely that you made it here without agreeing with us that the slow genocide of our people is something that we must fight. Nonetheless, let this serve as a sort of primer for any of you who may be confused as to what this site represents, who writes its articles and why there is this sort of blog in the first place, after all it's like \[current year] right?

### Breaking Through the Brainwash

The primary goal of this blog is _not to give the Guru headaches_ but instead to provide a source of media for the pro-white movement that is not simply changed to the media milleau of the mass media. Meaning, this is not to be a list of articles where we give our input about whatever crap is trending on twitter. We may comment on these issues, if they pertain to our movement, but the idea is to provide you with _non-violent_ ammunition to approach these subjects as an informed and rational member of the movement. 

We recognize that in this media climate, whites are going to snap. However, _we urge you to not do anything illegal_, it puts us all at risk and makes things harder for us. While many good men have, and eventually it may become a larger percentage of us that do, it does not help the movement if you are yet another reason they dub us as terrorists. _Though if you go to jail, please make inroads with our brothers locked up, we will need them too._

### Double Standards

We live in a world where representing our own kind's interests, being a _**white nationalist**_ makes us terrorists. We do not advocate for anything we do not accept, even expect, in other people's and find the suggestion that somehow we need not have organization's advocating for our interests absurd, if not suicidal. Does this mean we hate \[insert adjective you take to mean your identity]? Only if you hate us, which is not something one would find offensive if my skin were a darker shade than driven snow. 

As far as I am aware, and you know this is true as well, white peoples are the only groups in the world that Western media does not allow to advocate for our own interests. 

#### 'But Like Society is Your Interests'

**No its not**, if it were it would not be so determined to shame us for existing, for our ancestors raising the modern world you enjoy out of the dirt heaps that preceeded it and _especially_ would not constantly advocate for lower birthrates in an appeal to our greed. 

Beyond that, what you consider white probably includes a desert wandering tribe of ill-repute. No the coin-clippers are not 'whites' anymore than Hispanics or Arabs. This is a label they take on and off as it suits them and use their undue influence in the media to play that magic trick while the befuddled, of whatever color, buy it hook, line and sinker. But there is a better way to determine who is white and not than simply self-reported shekel-steins saying so:

> White peoples are those who have ethnic origins within the European continent and are not Jews or Muslims by religion, or of the 'indigenious' peoples in Northern Europe recognized by the EU or Russian Federation. 

To make this more clear, here are some examples
| People | Traditional Religion | Indigenious Tribal Status | White |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Irish | Catholic | No | Yes |
| Hungarians | Catholic | No but should be | Yes |
| Bosians | Muslim | No | No, Muslims |
| Germans | Protestant / Reformed / Catholic | No | Yes |
| Russians (slavic) | Orthodox | No | Yes |
| Komi | Orthodox | Yes | No |
| Albians | Muslim | No | No, Muslims |

##### Why Not Muslims

Due to the waves of those people displacing the truly native Europeans in most of Europe today. Albanians and Bosnians are fringe cases, to be sure, but due to the media perception of them as 'Muslims' and that earning them a darling status, the reality is to consider them white is to allow for too many fringe cases. The Turks are less fringe-case material but have long had stable populations in German-speaking regions. But as the US has long had a stable Black population, they are still not white. 

##### Why Not the Sami and Others

First, look at them on Google and tell me they should be considered part of our oppressed people. They also get a recognition status that white get **nowhere on Earth**. Maybe if that changes, we will shift our stance but until then, sorry Lapplanders.
